# Discord Chat Moderator

## What am I? 🧠 
A(n NLP) discord bot :)

## What is my purpose? 💼

To moderate chats to ensure conversations aren't hateful.

## How do I serve this purpose? 📝
You will be trained on an ocean of existing conversations on Discord. Hopefully this will allow to accurately classify conversations as either hateful or not.

At runtime, you will monitor Discord conversations and if you identify a conversation to be hateful, you will issue a warning to participants. Particpants include individuals who send and reply/interact with hateful messages. If a participant continues conversations identified as hateful, you will mute them for 10 minutes. Again, if they continue, you mute them for double their previous mute duration i.e. 20 minutes. This will be repeated for 4 iterations. If the partipant continues beyond this, they will be indefinitely muted until a manager unmutes them.

## What does my future hold? 🔮
Eventually, you will also develop the ability to review messages that are flagged as hateful by 2+ Server members. I'd also like to retain a 'hateful speech' score against Server members.

## Where am I hosted? ☁️
Who knows. The world's your oyster right now.

## Am I doing a good job? 🕒
Time will tell.
